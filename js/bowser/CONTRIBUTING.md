# Contributing

The project runs Git-flow, where the `master` branch is the production one and the `develop` is the developing one.

In a nutshell, if you're about to propose a new feature with adding new functionality to bowser, it's better to branch from `develop` and make a PR pointing to `develop` as well.
If it's a small hotfix, fix a typo in the docs or you've added support for a new browser/OS/platform/etc, then it's better to branch from `master` and make a PR pointing to `master` as well.
Following these simple rules will help to maintain the repo a lot! Thanks ❤️
